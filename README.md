# hello-world
Hi there! Lorena here. This is a place where I will store some ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. Also, this is my first repository :)

### A local community to support women in STEM, yay!

> “We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone. Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system.” -- Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, at her "Teach girls bravery, not perfection" TED Talk.

I am part of this awesome group called [Girls Support Girls](https://github.com/girls-support-girls), which is an initiative of students from the Department of Computer Science (DCC, the acronym in Portuguese) at UFMG, and we have created a survival guide for the freshmen at our university, [take a look](https://github.com/girls-support-girls/survival-guide/wiki) ;)

I even wrote a [little thing](https://github.com/girls-support-girls/survival-guide/wiki/Caso-voc%C3%AA-esteja-entrando-em-p%C3%A2nico) over there! :sparkles: hehe

### btw, [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare) TED Talk by Reshma Saujani is ___amazing!___

> “We need to make it safe for girls to fail." YES, DESPERATELY!!!

### the 100 best things in the world.

[Fernando](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/), who is a great professor and researcher at UFMG, inspired me to make my _100 best things in the world_'s list. [This](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc024/ementa/pofs/100coisas.html) is his. You can read mine [here](https://github.com/lorenaleao/hello-world/blob/master/as100melhorescoisasdomundo.md) (it's still a work in progress. in fact, I think it will always be changed from time to time ;).
